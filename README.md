## Inspiration

This app is mainly made by the need of have a good inventory for the company I'm currently working.
As an autodidact develper, I thought I could help the company doing a simple app to help with their inventory, the app has improved the time the managers have to spend on inventory, because they only have to upload all the new items, then if they want they can send the updated Excel file to the corresponding deparment, or just log in into the platform and download the file.
The project has been used for 6 months, and so far it has been working as expected. Is expected that as more features are added the project grows to be commercial for small businesses.
